Simple frontend web application that makes requests to the third-party [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/google-scholar-cite-api) endpoint to retrieve Google Scholar citations. Made with React.

Built mainly for personal use when writing papers and reports.

## Functionality

Search Citations <i class="fab fa-searchengin"></i>:

- Search research papers and immediately get citation data without information noise

## To Do

Log Previously Searched Citations <i class="fas fa-save"></i>:

- Cache all searched citations within session
- Viable for a small frontend application, as opposed to storing search or citation strings in a database


## Demo

![Citation Grab Home Page](/images/citation-grab_home.png)

Home page of Citation Grab. Just search for any research paper as if you are searching directly on Google Scholar!

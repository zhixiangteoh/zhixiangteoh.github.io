[^1]: MongoDB is a document database that generally serves as the backend service for MERN apps, while React.js is the client-side JavaScript framework that renders web elements. Express.js and Node.js make up the JavaScript web server. See also: [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack#:~:text=MERN%20stands%20for%20MongoDB%2C%20Express,%29%20%2D%20Node.js%20web%20framework)
[^2]: Here, fuzzy matching (more accurately [approximate string matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching)) refers to matching records based on approximate search terms, e.g. searching "naitonal" will find "National University of Singapore" as one of the matches.

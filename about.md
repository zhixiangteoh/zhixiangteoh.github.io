I'm a [Computer Science](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/eecs/) and [Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/undergraduate-math-courses.html) student from Singapore studying at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Most recently, I've joined the [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) (MLH) Spring 2021 [Open Source Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source)!

Outside of class, I spend my time at [Pitt Math Club](http://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/content/math-club-prime-numbers-patterns-and-applications) and MLH, and also work on [projects](./index.html#projects) as a way to learn and practice new technologies.

I'm currently looking for internships, research opportunities, and development projects primarily in Java, JavaScript, C++, or Python. I particularly enjoy writing in markdown and $\LaTeX$; this website is essentially written in markdown!

My favorite quote, that also sums up how I feel about open source software:
> If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
